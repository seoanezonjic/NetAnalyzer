NetAnalyzer
===========


    Python library for network analysis, operations and priorization.

This package is designed to perform various steps in network analysis and processing through a modular design. Key features include:

* Randomization: Enables randomization of both clustered and individual nodes or edges within networks.
* Projections: Simplifies network complexity by reducing the number of layers based on connections from an excluded layer. For example, it can transition from a Phenotype-Patient-Mutation network to a Patient-Mutation network, connecting layers based on common nodes between patients and mutations.
* Topological Analysis: Computes various topological metrics for nodes (e.g., degree, betweenness) and provides summary statistics for entire networks.
* Cluster analysis: Performs metrics on predefined clusters and applies clustering algorithms based on the cdlib library.
* Embedding of networks (Kernels and node2vec): Defines node similarity using methods for processing context information in networks, including classical Kernel approaches and node2vec. It also supports integration of multiple layers.
* Prioritization: Applies propagation algorithms to prioritize nodes based on similarity metrics, such as the adjacency matrix, and a set of seed nodes.
* Net plotting: Provides several tools for graphing networks from different net plotter packages (igraph, cytoscape, graphviz).
